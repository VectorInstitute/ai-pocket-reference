## Overview

The AI Pocket Reference project is maintained by Vector AI Engineering as an accessible
resource for the AI community. It is built using the [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)
tool and serves as a quick reference guide for essential AI concepts, making it
easier to find and understand key information without diving into lengthy documentation.

## What is a Pocket Reference?

A Pocket Reference is designed to be both an entry point for newcomers and a quick
refresher for experienced practitioners. Core characteristics include:

- Concise explanations of AI concepts and jargon terms
- Each pocket reference is no longer than 7 minutes of calculated reading time
- Includes curated links to further readings and resources

To enhance understanding, some pocket references may also include:

- Illustrative diagrams
- Links to supplementary sample code

Whether you're learning a topic for the first time or need to quickly refresh your
understanding, each reference serves as both a starting point and a gateway to
deeper knowledge through carefully selected additional resources. The AI Pocket
References are actively maintained, with new references being added to stay relevant
with the evolving field of AI.
