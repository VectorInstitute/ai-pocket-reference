# AI Pocket Reference

A pocket reference book maintained by Vector AI.

## Setup

Install `mdbook`, a Rust binary that we use for building our books. We'll make
use of `cargo`, which is Rust's package installer and manager. First install,
Rust:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After installing Rust, restart your shell so that we can use the `cargo` cli tool.
Next, install `mdbook`

```sh
cargo install mdbook
```

With mdbook installed onto your machine, you can now create docs locally on your
machine.
