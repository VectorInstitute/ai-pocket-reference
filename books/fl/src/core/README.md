# Core Concepts in Federated Learning

{{ #aipr_header }}

In this chapter, we'll introduce several of the fundamental concepts for
understanding federated learning (FL). We begin by discussing some of the
different [flavors of FL](fl_flavors.md) and why they constitute
distinct subdomains each with their own applications, challenges, and research
literature. Next, we briefly discuss three of the most important building
blocks associated with FL pipelines: [Clients](client.md),
[Servers](server.md), and [Aggregation](aggregation.md).
