# Explainability & Interpretability

{{ #aipr_header }}

## Introduction

Explainability and interpretability are essential for understanding,
trusting, and governing AI systems. They help answer questions like _“Why
did the model make this decision?”_ and _“Can I rely on it?”_, which are
critical for debugging, fairness, accountability, and regulatory compliance.

- **Interpretability** refers to how well humans can understand the internal
mechanics of a model (e.g., weights, activations).
- **Explainability** focuses on making model behavior understandable to humans,
often through external or post-hoc means.

These are especially important in **high-stakes domains** such as healthcare,
criminal justice, finance, and education.

Techniques fall into two main types:

- **Intrinsic**: Models that are interpretable by design (e.g., decision trees,
rule-based systems).
- **Post-hoc**: Applied after training to explain complex "black box" models
(e.g., deep neural nets, LLMs).

| **Method / Tool**   | **Type**         | **Use Case**                               | **Notes**                                       |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **SHAP** [^1]        | Post-hoc         | Global + local feature importance          | Based on game theory (Shapley values); model-agnostic |
| **LIME** [^2]        | Post-hoc         | Local explanation of specific predictions  | Perturbs input and fits interpretable model locally |
| **Attention Maps**   | Intrinsic        | Visualize what models "focus" on           | Often used in Transformers for NLP and vision  |
| **Captum** [^3]      | Library          | Attribution methods for PyTorch            | Supports Integrated Gradients, DeepLift, etc.  |
| **TokenSHAP** [^4]   | Post-hoc         | Token-level attribution in LLMs            | Monte Carlo estimation of Shapley values       |
| **LLMCheckup** [^5]  | Tooling          | Conversational introspection of LLMs       | Explores self-consistency, token flow, explanation quality |
| **OpenAI Model Explorer** [^openai] | Tooling | Tokenization + attention visualization      | Useful for prompt design and model understanding |
| **Interpretability-by-Design** | Intrinsic | Simpler models: linear, tree-based, rule-based | Useful when transparency is prioritized over performance |

## LLMs: Special Challenges

Large language models (LLMs) pose unique challenges:

- **Scale and opacity**: Millions/billions of parameters make the internal
logic of thee models hard to trace.
- **Context sensitivity**: Token influence is highly non-linear and
interaction-heavy.
- **Prompt-based behavior**: Meaning can be heavily altered by the phrasing
or order of your prompt.

### Useful Approaches

- **Token-level attribution** (TokenSHAP, Integrated Gradients)
- **Activation tracing** (e.g., LogitLens, ROME-style editing)
- **Interactive introspection** (e.g., LLMCheckup, OpenAI’s Explorer)
- **Behavioral unit testing** (e.g., CheckList for LLMs)

LLMs also benefit from **prompt engineering** techniques for self-explanation
(e.g., "Think step-by-step", "Why did you answer this way?").

## Best Practices

- **Audience-aware explanations**: Engineers may need saliency maps, end-users
need rationale in plain-language.
- **Validate explanation fidelity**: Don’t assume correctness, some tools
hallucinate or oversimplify.
- **Combine multiple methods**: E.g., SHAP + attention + perturbation for
cross-validation.
- **Embed in governance workflows**: Use interpretability in model cards,
 audits, red-teaming, and model evaluation.

## Final Thoughts

Explainability isn’t just about model transparency, it’s about accountability,
alignment, and usability. It should be:

- **Faithful**: Accurately reflect model behavior.
- **Actionable**: Support debugging, trust, or governance.
- **Audience-tailored**: Right level of detail for developers, users, or
regulators.

As models grow more complex, so does the burden of explainability, and the
importance of safe and fair AI deployment.
