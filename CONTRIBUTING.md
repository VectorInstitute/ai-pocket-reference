## Contributor Notice

By contributing to the AI Pocket References collection, you agree to release your
contributions under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) 1.0 Universal license. This means:

- You waive all copyright and related rights to your contributions
- Your work becomes part of the public domain
- Others can freely use, modify, and distribute the content without attribution requirements

While attribution is not legally required under CC0, we maintain a record of contributions
through:

- Git history
- Contributor listings on pocket reference pages
- Community discussions and interactions

## Recognition

Contributors are recognized on each pocket reference page they create or substantially
modify. This voluntary attribution helps:

- Track the evolution of content
- Foster community engagement
- Provide points of contact for questions or feedback
- Acknowledge the collaborative nature of the project

When a pocket reference evolves through multiple contributors:

- The original author is listed as the primary contributor
- Subsequent contributors who make substantial modifications are also listed
- All contributions are tracked in git history

For example, a pocket reference might show:

```md
Contributors:
Original: @author1
Substantial edits: @author2, @author3
```
